Adobe Phonegap Build - uploading code larger than the 15MB upload limit
=======================================================================

At the time of writing this post, [Adobe Phonegap Build](https://build.phonegap.com) allows only 15MB to be uploaded using a `.zip` file.

To use code larger than this limit, use [github](https://github.com/) to fetch your code instead!
